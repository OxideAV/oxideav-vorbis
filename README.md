Pure-Rust Vorbis I audio codec — clean-room rebuild, round 9.

## Status — 2026-05-24

**Round 9 landed: floor type 1 per-packet decode + curve computation
(Vorbis I §7.2.3 "packet decode" + §7.2.4 "curve computation").**
[`Floor1Decoder`] turns the floor payload of an audio packet into a
linear-domain spectral envelope of length `n` (= `blocksize/2`). It reads
the `[nonzero]` flag (returning `Unused` if clear), the two
`ilog([range]-1)`-bit endpoint amplitudes, and per partition the
master-book selector (only when `[cbits] > 0`) followed by the
per-dimension sub-book scalar amplitudes, yielding `[floor1_Y]`; then
unwraps those positive differences through iterative `render_point` line
prediction (§7.2.4 step 1) and renders the sorted contiguous line
segments via `render_line` (§7.2.4 step 2) before substituting through
the §10.1 inverse-dB table. End-of-packet mid-decode is the §7.2.3
nominal occurrence (return `Unused`). This is the floor half of the
§4.3.2 audio-packet pipeline that complements round 8's residue half.

**Round 8 landed: per-packet residue decode (Vorbis I §8.6.2 "packet
decode" + §8.6.3/§8.6.4/§8.6.5 "format 0/1/2 specifics").**
[`ResidueDecoder`] turns the residue payload of an audio packet into one
`Vec<f32>` per channel: it caps the begin/end range to the per-format
vector size, reads each partition's classification from the classbook in
scalar context (pass 0), and over passes 0..=7 accumulates the
stage-`pass` value codebook's VQ vectors into the output — format 0
interleaved-scatter, format 1 contiguous, format 2 interleave→format-1→
de-interleave. End-of-packet mid-decode is the §8.6.2 nominal occurrence
(stop and return work-so-far). Round 7 landed VQ vector unpack
([`unpack_vector`]), lifting a decoded Huffman entry index into a fixed
`codebook.dimensions`-element `Vec<f32>` by walking the spec's
mixed-base permutation (`lookup_type = 1`, lattice) or one-to-one
slice (`lookup_type = 2`, tessellation) of the codebook's multiplicand
table, honouring `sequence_p` as a running prefix-sum of the per-element
`multiplicand × delta + minimum` term. Round 6 landed the rest of the
setup-header walker — mapping configurations (§4.2.4 "Mappings",
`mapping_type = 0` only), mode configurations (§4.2.4 "Modes"), and the
trailing framing flag. Round 5 landed the setup-header outer walker
(codebooks + time-domain placeholders + floor headers + residue
headers); round 4 the canonical Huffman tree builder + entry decoder
(§3.2.1); round 3 the codebook-header parser (§3.2.1); round 2 the
comment-header parser (§5); round 1 the identification-header parser
(§4.2.2) on 2026-05-20.

The crate's prior implementation was retired under the workspace
clean-room policy because module-level docstrings and inline comments
referenced libvorbis internals as their provenance source. The current
master is an orphan rebuild that started from a `NotImplemented`
scaffold; round 1 lands the identification header, round 2 the
comment header.

### What works

* [`parse_identification_header`] reads a 30-byte Vorbis I
  identification-header packet (Vorbis I §4.2.2) and returns a
  [`VorbisIdentificationHeader`] struct exposing:
  * `vorbis_version` (u32; must be 0 for Vorbis I)
  * `audio_channels` (u8; must be > 0)
  * `audio_sample_rate` (u32, Hz; must be > 0)
  * `bitrate_maximum` / `bitrate_nominal` / `bitrate_minimum`
    (signed i32 hints; 0 means "unset" per §4.2.2)
  * `blocksize_0` / `blocksize_1` (u16, sample counts; one of
    {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192} per §4.2.2, with
    `blocksize_0 <= blocksize_1`)
* All spec-mandated validity checks from §4.2.2 are enforced: packet
  length, common-header magic + packet type, nonzero
  channels/sample_rate, blocksize exponents in 6..=13, blocksize
  ordering, framing flag nonzero.
* [`parse_comment_header`] reads a Vorbis I comment-header packet
  (§5.2.1 / §5.2.3) and returns a [`VorbisCommentHeader`] exposing:
  * `vendor` (UTF-8 String; the encoder's vendor identification, e.g.
    `"Lavf61.7.100"` or `"Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20020717"`)
  * `comments` (Vec<String>; raw UTF-8 entries in `KEY=value` form
    per §5.2.2, preserving insertion order)
* All spec-mandated invariants from §5.2.1 are enforced: common-header
  packet type (`0x03`) + `"vorbis"` magic, UTF-8 validation of the
  vendor and every comment entry, length-prefix overflow guard,
  truncation reported as a structured `UnexpectedEndOfPacket` so
  callers can apply the §4.2 "non-fatal" relaxation if desired,
  framing-bit check.
* Helpers: [`split_key_value`] cuts an entry on the first `=` octet
  per §5.2.2; [`VorbisCommentHeader::key_value_iter`] yields
  `(key, value)` pairs and skips malformed (no-`=`) entries.
* [`parse_codebook`] reads a Vorbis I codebook header (§3.2.1) from
  an LSB-first [`oxideav_core::bits::BitReaderLsb`] positioned at
  the 24-bit `0x564342` sync pattern. Returns a [`VorbisCodebook`]
  exposing:
  * `dimensions` (u16; 16-bit unsigned)
  * `entries` (u32; 24-bit unsigned)
  * `codeword_lengths` (Vec<u8>; per-entry length in `1..=32`, or
    [`UNUSED_ENTRY`]`= 0` for sparse-codebook unused entries)
  * `lookup` ([`VqLookup`]; `None` for `lookup_type=0`, `Lattice`
    for `lookup_type=1`, `Tessellation` for `lookup_type=2`,
    carrying the unpacked `minimum_value` / `delta_value` floats
    (§9.2.2), `value_bits` in `1..=16`, `sequence_p` flag, and the
    raw multiplicand table)
* Codebook helpers exposed at the crate root: [`ilog`] (§9.2.1),
  [`float32_unpack`] (§9.2.2), [`lookup1_values`] (§9.2.3). The
  ordered length-encoding branch (§3.2.1 step 3 ordered subcase)
  reuses `ilog(entries - current_entry)` for the per-run width.
* All §3.2.1 invariants are enforced and surface as
  `codebook::ParseError` variants (`BadSyncPattern`, `ZeroEntries`,
  `OrderedOverflow`, `ReservedLookupType`, `UnexpectedEndOfPacket`).
* [`HuffmanTree::from_codebook`] / [`HuffmanTree::from_lengths`]
  builds a canonical Vorbis I Huffman decision tree (§3.2.1) from the
  per-entry `codeword_lengths` table. Construction uses a left-to-right
  open-position deque: each used entry pops the leftmost open slot and
  either places a leaf there or splits it down to the entry's recorded
  depth (allocating internal nodes + pushing both new children to the
  deque front). The spec's worked example (lengths `[2 4 4 4 4 2 3 3]`
  → codewords `00 0100 0101 0110 0111 10 110 111`) round-trips
  exactly.
* [`HuffmanTree::decode_entry`] walks the tree against an LSb-first
  [`BitReaderLsb`]: each read bit selects `left` (0) or `right` (1)
  until a leaf is hit, then returns the leaf's entry index. The first
  bit read is the MSb of the canonical codeword per the §3.2.1 "the
  leftmost bit is the MSb" convention; under §2.1.4 LSb-first packing
  this means the encoder writes codewords with their MSb going into
  the LSb of the next stream byte.
* Errata 20150226 single-entry codebooks: a codebook with exactly one
  used entry whose recorded length is `1` builds a synthetic tree
  whose root's `left` and `right` both point at the same leaf, so
  `decode_entry` returns that entry and sinks one bit on either a `0`
  or a `1` (per the errata "decoders should tolerate that the bit
  read from the stream be '1' instead of '0'"). Single-entry
  codebooks with `length != 1` are rejected with
  [`HuffmanBuildError::SingleEntryWrongLength`].
* Underspecified / overspecified detection (§3.2.1 errata 20150226):
  any leftover open deque positions after every used entry has been
  placed → [`HuffmanBuildError::UnderspecifiedTree`]; popping the
  deque dry before all entries are placed →
  [`HuffmanBuildError::OverspecifiedTree`]. Out-of-range lengths
  (anything outside `1..=32`) surface as
  [`HuffmanBuildError::InvalidLength`], and zero used entries as
  [`HuffmanBuildError::EmptyTree`].
* [`parse_setup_header`] / [`parse_setup_header_body`] now walk the
  **entire** Vorbis I setup-header packet (§4.2.4). Both entry points
  take the stream's `audio_channels` (from the identification header)
  because the mapping decode reads channel-number widths of
  `ilog(audio_channels - 1)` bits:
  * `vorbis_codebook_count` codebook configurations (delegated to
    [`parse_codebook`]; §3.2.1).
  * `vorbis_time_count` 16-bit time-domain transform placeholders —
    each spec-mandated to equal zero (§4.2.4 step 2; any nonzero value
    is rejected with `SetupParseError::NonZeroTimePlaceholder`).
  * `vorbis_floor_count` floor headers. Each carries a 16-bit
    `floor_type`; type 0 (§6.2.1) and type 1 (§7.2.2) decode their
    structural fields (no per-packet curve decode), type > 1 is
    rejected. [`Floor1Header`] exposes `partitions`,
    `partition_class_list`, `classes` (per-class `dimensions`,
    `subclasses`, optional `masterbook`, `subclass_books`),
    `multiplier`, `rangebits`, `x_list`. [`Floor0Header`] exposes
    `order`, `rate`, `bark_map_size`, `amplitude_bits`,
    `amplitude_offset`, `book_list`.
  * `vorbis_residue_count` residue headers (§8.6.1 — common header
    layout across types 0/1/2). [`ResidueHeader`] exposes
    `residue_type` (0/1/2; >2 is rejected), `residue_begin`,
    `residue_end`, `partition_size`, `classifications`, `classbook`,
    `cascade[classifications]`, and `books[classifications][8]` with
    `None` entries for cascade-bit-unset stages.
  * `vorbis_mapping_count` mapping configurations (§4.2.4 "Mappings",
    `mapping_type = 0` only — any other type is rejected per step 2b).
    [`MappingHeader`] exposes `mapping_type`, `submaps` (1 or 4-bit
    encoded), `coupling` (per-step `(magnitude_channel, angle_channel)`
    pairs read at `ilog(audio_channels - 1)` bits each, with the spec's
    "magnitude != angle and both < audio_channels" validation), `mux`
    (per-channel submap routing; only present when `submaps > 1`), and
    `submap_configs` (the 8-bit time placeholder + the 8-bit floor /
    residue indices, both range-checked against the prior counts).
  * `vorbis_mode_count` mode configurations (§4.2.4 "Modes").
    [`ModeHeader`] exposes `blockflag`, `windowtype` (forced to 0 per
    step 2e), `transformtype` (forced to 0 per step 2e), and `mapping`
    (range-checked against `mapping_count`).
  * The trailing 1-bit framing flag (§4.2.4 "Modes" step 3) is read
    and required to be set; the flag value is also surfaced as
    `VorbisSetupHeader::framing_flag` for downstream inspection.
* [`unpack_vector`] applies a codebook's `codebook_lookup_type` to a
  Huffman entry index `lookup_offset` to recover the per-entry VQ
  vector (Vorbis I §3.2.1 + §3.3). Returns a `Vec<f32>` of length
  exactly `codebook.dimensions`. Three branches:
  * `VqLookup::None` → [`VqUnpackError::NoVectorForType0`] (§3.3:
    "requesting decode using a codebook of lookup type 0 in any
    context expecting a vector return value … is forbidden").
  * `VqLookup::Lattice` (lookup type 1) → mixed-base permutation per
    §3.2.1 "Vector value decode: Lookup type 1" — `multiplicand_offset
    = (lookup_offset / index_divisor) mod codebook_lookup_values` for
    each dimension `i`, with `index_divisor` multiplied by
    `codebook_lookup_values` between iterations.
  * `VqLookup::Tessellation` (lookup type 2) → direct one-to-one slice
    per §3.2.1 "Vector value decode: Lookup type 2" —
    `multiplicand_offset = lookup_offset * codebook_dimensions`,
    then increment per iteration.
  * Both honour `sequence_p`: when set, `[last]` carries forward the
    full prior `value_vector[i]` (post-`min`, post-`delta`,
    post-`last`), making the output a prefix-sum; when clear, `[last]`
    stays at `0.0`. Structured `VqUnpackError` variants:
    `EntryOutOfRange`, `NoVectorForType0`, `ZeroDimensions`,
    `MultiplicandShapeMismatch`.
* [`ResidueDecoder`] decodes the per-packet residue payload (Vorbis I
  §8.6.2 + §8.6.3/§8.6.4/§8.6.5) into one `Vec<f32>` per channel.
  [`ResidueDecoder::new`] validates the §8.6.1 undecodability clauses
  (classbook + value-book indices in range, value books carry a value
  mapping, classbook dimensions nonzero) and pre-builds the classbook +
  value-book Huffman trees once. [`ResidueDecoder::decode`] runs the
  §8.6.2 packet decode:
  * caps `[residue_begin]`/`[residue_end]` to the actual vector size —
    `blocksize/2` for format 0/1, `blocksize/2 × ch` for format 2 (the
    interleaved-vector cap of §8.6.2 step 3);
  * derives `classwords_per_codeword` (= classbook dimensions),
    `n_to_read`, `partitions_to_read`, returning the zeroed vectors when
    `n_to_read == 0`;
  * on pass 0 reads each partition's classification from the classbook
    in scalar context, unpacking `classwords_per_codeword`
    classifications per codeword by the descending integer-divide /
    integer-modulo by `residue_classifications` (§8.6.2 steps 9..12);
  * over passes 0..=7 looks up each partition's stage-`pass` value book
    and, if not `unused`, decodes the partition into the output in VQ
    context, *accumulating* (`+=`) per §8.6.2 step 19 so cascade stages
    stack;
  * format 0 (§8.6.3) scatters element `j` to `offset + i + j×step`;
    format 1 (§8.6.4) appends contiguously; format 2 (§8.6.5) decodes a
    single interleaved vector of length `ch × blocksize/2` as a format-1
    decode then de-interleaves `v[i×ch + j] → output[j][i]`, with the
    all-`do not decode` short-circuit;
  * treats end-of-packet mid-decode as the §8.6.2 nominal occurrence —
    decode stops and returns the vectors-so-far instead of erroring.
  Structured [`ResidueError`] variants (`UnsupportedFormat`,
  `ClassbookOutOfRange`, `ValueBookOutOfRange`, `ValueBookHasNoLookup`,
  `ZeroClasswordsPerCodeword`, `Format0PartitionNotDivisible`,
  `Huffman`, `Vq`).
* [`Floor1Decoder`] decodes the per-packet floor type 1 payload (Vorbis
  I §7.2.3 + §7.2.4) into a linear-domain spectral envelope.
  [`Floor1Decoder::new`] reconstructs the full `[floor1_X_list]` —
  prepending the implicit endpoints `0` and `2^rangebits` — validates the
  §7.2.2 undecodability clauses (multiplier in `1..=4`, `[floor1_values]`
  ≤ 65, x-list uniqueness, master/sub-book indices in range) and
  pre-builds every referenced codebook's Huffman tree once.
  [`Floor1Decoder::decode`] runs:
  * §7.2.3 packet decode — reads the `[nonzero]` flag (returning
    `FloorCurve::Unused` if clear), the two `ilog([range]-1)`-bit
    endpoint amplitudes, and per partition the master-book selector (only
    when `[cbits] > 0`) then the per-dimension sub-book scalar
    amplitudes, with a negative/`None` sub-book forcing a `0` Y with no
    bits consumed (§7.2.3 step 16/18);
  * §7.2.4 step 1 — unwraps the positive `[floor1_Y]` differences through
    iterative `render_point` line prediction into `[floor1_final_Y]` +
    `[floor1_step2_flag]`, with the suggested `[0, range)` clamp;
  * §7.2.4 step 2 — sorts the `(X, final_Y, flag)` triples by ascending
    X, renders the contiguous integer line segments via `render_line`,
    and substitutes each integer floor sample through the §10.1
    `floor1_inverse_dB_table` (`INVERSE_DB_TABLE`) for a length-`n`
    linear envelope;
  * treats end-of-packet mid-decode as the §7.2.3 nominal occurrence —
    returns `FloorCurve::Unused` as if `[nonzero]` had been clear.
  The integer geometry helpers [`low_neighbor`] / [`high_neighbor`]
  (§9.2.4 / §9.2.5), [`render_point`] (§9.2.6) and [`render_line`]
  (§9.2.7) are public. Structured [`Floor1Error`] variants
  (`BookOutOfRange`, `BadMultiplier`, `TooManyValues`, `NonUniqueXList`,
  `Huffman`).
* 146 unit tests in total: 16 cover §4.2.2, 22 cover §5, 18 cover §3
  codebook-header parse, 13 cover §3.2.1 Huffman tree, 28 cover
  §4.2.4 setup-header walker, 16 cover §3.2.1 / §3.3 VQ unpack, 15 cover
  §8.6 residue decode, and **18 new round-9 tests cover §7.2 floor 1
  decode**: the §9.2.6/§9.2.7 render-point/render-line geometry
  (up/down/flat segments, endpoint-not-written), the §9.2.4/§9.2.5
  neighbor lookups, all four §7.2.2 construction-validation rejections, a
  hand-traced full `curve_computation`, a full packet→curve round trip,
  the master/subclass cascade selector path, the `nonzero` unset path,
  two end-of-packet nominal-`Unused` paths (mid-amplitude + mid-codeword),
  the negative-sub-book zero-Y path, and the §10.1 table endpoints.

### What does not yet work

* Floor curve decode runtime for **floor type 0** (§6.2.2, §6.2.3 — LSP
  representation). libvorbis never produces floor 0, but the codepath
  exists in the spec; the round-9 work covers floor type 1 only.
* Mapping submap channel routing at packet time (which channels feed
  which residue, plus square-polar coupling inversion §A.3), mode /
  window decode, inverse MDCT, and TDAC overlap-add (§4.3, §10).
* Top-level audio-packet decode (§4.3.2) tying floor + residue + the
  per-mapping channel plumbing together. `Floor1Decoder` is the floor
  half and `ResidueDecoder` the residue half; the packet-level loop that
  drives them in channel order — computing each channel's `do not decode`
  flag from the floor's `nonzero`/`Unused` result and applying §4.3.3
  nonzero-vector propagation across coupled channels — is still pending.
* Ogg framing (RFC 3533 + Vorbis I §A) — the parsers are currently
  bring-your-own-packet. Consuming an Ogg-encapsulated stream needs
  to be wired up via `oxideav-ogg`.
* `METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE` base64 + FLAC-PICTURE block decoding (see
  trace-doc §2.3) — the comment parser returns the raw base64 string
  as a comment value; FLAC-PICTURE decoding belongs in a higher-level
  consumer.
* No [`oxideav_core::Decoder`] / [`oxideav_core::Encoder`] is
  registered yet; `decode_packet` returns `Error::NotImplemented`.

## Clean-room sources

Rounds 1 — 9 were implemented against, and only against:

* `docs/audio/vorbis/Vorbis_I_spec.pdf` — Xiph.Org Vorbis I
  Specification, 2020-07-04 revision. Round 1 used §2 Bitpacking
  Convention, §4.2.1 Common header decode, §4.2.2 Identification
  header. Round 2 used §4.2 (end-of-packet handling), §4.2.1, §4.2.3,
  §5.1, §5.2.1 (structure / decoder pseudocode), §5.2.2 (content
  vector format), §5.2.3 (encoder-side recap). Round 3 used §3.1
  (codebook overview), §3.2.1 (codebook decode algorithm), §9.2.1
  (`ilog`), §9.2.2 (`float32_unpack`), §9.2.3 (`lookup1_values`).
  Round 4 used §3.2.1 "Huffman decision tree representation" (the
  worked-example codeword table for lengths `[2 4 4 4 4 2 3 3]` plus
  the underspecified / overspecified discussion), the §3.2.1 errata
  20150226 "Single entry codebooks" addendum, and §3.3 "Use of the
  codebook abstraction" (decode-time bit-walking semantics + the
  end-of-packet condition). Round 5 used §4.2.4 "Setup header"
  (Codebooks / Time domain transforms / Floors / Residues subsections,
  the "Time domain transforms" must-be-zero rejection, the floor-type
  > 1 and residue-type > 2 rejections, and the in-spec floor 0 / floor
  1 / residue branches), §6.2.1 "Floor 0 header decode", §7.2.2 "Floor
  1 header decode" (steps 1..23), and §8.6.1 "Residue header decode"
  (the begin/end/partition_size/classifications/classbook fields, the
  per-classification cascade bitmap with `high_bits = read 5 bits if
  bitflag`, and the conditional per-stage book reads). Round 6 used
  §4.2.4 "Mappings" (steps 1..2 inclusive of the `mapping_type != 0`
  rejection, the optional submaps and square-polar coupling subblocks,
  the `ilog(audio_channels - 1)`-bit magnitude/angle channel reads,
  the "magnitude != angle and both < audio_channels" validation
  paragraph, the 2-bit reserved field, the `mux[ch]` reads gated on
  `submaps > 1` with the OOB check, and the per-submap placeholder +
  floor + residue index reads with their respective OOB checks),
  §4.2.4 "Modes" (the per-mode blockflag / windowtype / transformtype /
  mapping reads plus step 2e's `windowtype == 0`, `transformtype == 0`,
  and `mapping < mapping_count` enforcement), and §4.2.4 "Modes"
  step 3 (the trailing framing-flag requirement). §9.2.1 `ilog` is
  reused via [`crate::codebook::ilog`]. Round 7 used §3.2.1 "VQ
  lookup table vector representation" introductory paragraph (the
  eight values consumed by the unpack: `codebook_multiplicands`,
  `codebook_minimum_value`, `codebook_delta_value`,
  `codebook_sequence_p`, `codebook_lookup_type`, `codebook_entries`,
  `codebook_dimensions`, `codebook_lookup_values`), §3.2.1 "Vector
  value decode: Lookup type 1" (lattice mixed-base permutation
  pseudocode, steps 1..8), §3.2.1 "Vector value decode: Lookup type
  2" (tessellation one-to-one pseudocode, steps 1..7), and §3.3
  "Use of the codebook abstraction" — the explicit prohibition on
  requesting a VQ value out of a `lookup_type = 0` codebook ("even
  in a case where a vector of dimension one … is an error condition
  rendering the packet undecodable"), and the entry-index → VQ
  vector hand-off after a successful tree walk. §9.2.3
  `lookup1_values` is reused via [`crate::codebook::lookup1_values`]
  for the type-1 shape cross-check. Round 8 used §8.6.2 "packet decode"
  (the begin/end limiting steps 1..5 including the format-2 `actual_size
  = actual_size * ch` rule, the `classwords_per_codeword` / `n_to_read`
  / `partitions_to_read` convenience values, the `n_to_read == 0`
  early-out, the pass 0..=7 loop, the pass-0 classbook scalar read with
  the descending modulo/divide classification unpack at steps 9..12, the
  step 13..20 per-partition VQ decode loop with the `vqbook` "unused"
  skip, and the "end-of-packet … is to be considered a nominal
  occurrence" clause), §8.6.3 "format 0 specifics" (`step = n /
  codebook_dimensions`, the `offset + i + j*step` scatter), §8.6.4
  "format 1 specifics" (the contiguous `offset + i` append loop), and
  §8.6.5 "format 2 specifics" (the all-`do not decode` short-circuit,
  the single `ch*n` interleaved format-1 decode, and the `v[i*ch + j] →
  output[j][i]` de-interleave). §8.6.1's undecodability clauses ("any
  codebook number greater than the maximum numbered codebook … renders
  the stream undecodable" and "all codebooks in array [residue books]
  are required to have a value mapping") were used for the construction
  validation. §3.2.1 / §3.3 are reused via [`crate::vq::unpack_vector`]
  and [`crate::huffman::HuffmanTree`] for the VQ-context partition reads
  and the classbook scalar reads. Round 9 used §7.2.3 "packet decode"
  (the `[nonzero]` flag at step 1, the `[range]` table lookup, the two
  `ilog([range]-1)`-bit endpoint amplitudes at steps 2..3, the
  per-partition steps 5..19 master-book selector + `cval & csub` /
  `cval >>= cbits` sub-book cascade + the negative-book zero-Y branch,
  and the closing "end-of-packet … nominal occurrence → return unused"
  note), §7.2.4 "curve computation" (step 1 amplitude synthesis with the
  `render_point` prediction, `highroom`/`lowroom`/`room` wrap arithmetic,
  the val-vs-room and odd/even branches, the suggested `[0, range)`
  clamp; step 2 curve synthesis with the ascending-X sort, the
  `render_line` segment chaining, the `hx < n` tail extension, and the
  `floor1_inverse_dB_table` substitution), §7.2.1 "model" (the
  iterative-prediction narrative), §9.2.4 "low neighbor", §9.2.5 "high
  neighbor", §9.2.6 "render point" (the integer line-solve), §9.2.7
  "render line" (the Bresenham-style integer line drawing with
  toward-zero division), and §10.1 "floor1 inverse dB table" (the
  256-element static table transcribed verbatim). §9.2.1 `ilog` is
  reused via [`crate::codebook::ilog`]; the scalar codebook reads use
  [`crate::huffman::HuffmanTree`].
* `docs/audio/vorbis/vorbis-fixtures-and-traces.md` — clean-room
  trace-corpus document. Round 2 referenced §2.2 (`mono-44100-q5-typical`
  and `with-vorbis-comment-tags` `VORBIS_HEADER_COMMENT` /
  `VORBIS_COMMENT_ENTRY` shapes), §2.3 (`METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE`
  convention), §9 (trace event vocabulary). Round 3 referenced §3
  (the `CODEBOOK` event shape — `book_idx dimensions entries
  ordered sparse lookup_type value_bits sequence_p` field set).
  Round 5 referenced §2.4 (`VORBIS_HEADER_SETUP` event shape —
  `codebook_count`, `time_count`, `floor_count`, `residue_count`,
  `mapping_count`, `mode_count`, `framing_flag`), §4 (`FLOOR_CONFIG`
  field shape — `floor_idx`, `type`, plus `partitions`,
  `multiplier`, `rangebits`, `x_list_count` for type 1), and §5
  (`RESIDUE_CONFIG` field shape — `residue_idx`, `type`, `begin`,
  `end`, `partition_size`, `classifications`, `classbook`). Round 6
  referenced §6 (`MAPPING_CONFIG` shape — `mapping_idx`, `type`,
  `submaps`, `coupling_steps`, `magnitude`, `angle`, `floor`,
  `residue`; including the §6 narrative confirming "stereo libvorbis
  output always uses one coupling step `(magnitude=L, angle=R)`,
  mono streams have `coupling_steps=0` and `submaps=1`, 5.1 streams
  use `submaps=2` with `mux=[0,0,0,0,0,1]` routing the LFE on its
  own submap") and §7 (`MODE_CONFIG` shape — `mode_idx`,
  `blockflag`, `windowtype`, `transformtype`, `mapping`, plus the
  trace narrative that mode 0 is the short-block mode and mode 1
  is the long-block mode in every libvorbis stream).

  — only as the source for the field-level shape of the test
  fixtures.

No external library source was consulted, quoted, paraphrased, or
used as a cross-check oracle, in accordance with the workspace
clean-room policy. The forbidden-list for this crate includes every
existing Vorbis implementation (the Xiph reference encoder/decoder,
Tremor, lewton, FFmpeg's Vorbis decoder, every third-party Rust
crate that wraps or implements the format).
